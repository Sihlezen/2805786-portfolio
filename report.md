In this lab, you have gained practical experience with version control and web deployment by using Git to manage project history and GitHub Pages to host a live site. You learned how to implement semantic HTML structures (such as <header>, <nav>, and <article>) to improve web accessibility and SEO while following strict technical requirements for automated evaluation. Finally, you mastered the process of creating a Git bundle file to package a repository's entire history and branches into a single deliverable for submission.
