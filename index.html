            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Siphesihle Merile I am a final Year BSc Computer Science Students and I love Computer Science very much.  In this lab, you have gained practical experience with version control and web deployment by using Git to manage project history and GitHub Pages to host a live site. You learned how to implement semantic HTML structures (such as <header>, <nav>, and <article>) to improve web accessibility and SEO while following strict technical requirements for automated evaluation. Finally, you mastered the process of creating a Git bundle file to package a repository's entire history and branches into a single deliverable for submission</p>
